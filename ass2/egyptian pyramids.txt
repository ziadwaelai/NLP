egyptian pyramids.

Greece has seen similar and more recent "decomposition" of its ancient pyramids under local or European control, says the team.

"If they come back into the Aegean system of Egypt - as the scientists suggest - their chances of ever finding further objects than they did in the late 19th and early 20th century are small," wrote Thomas E. F. Cretz, who led the search for the missing Egypt pyramids of Kolis and Karakai to a Washington, D.C., conference on Thursday, November 21. "It will take time, but they are in the very early stages of an eventual return to our culture's history."

Espionage, military or other, was the focus of the team's first year through the summer. Once the team concluded that any attempt to steal the ancient pyramids was considered futile and impossible, it went deeper. The Egyptians were aware of the danger a potential return to the site could put people at risk as well and the project was to identify a safe haven at the site with strong security for tourists and those who would return to the site, the paper explained.

Once this area was established by the Egyptian military, the team's main priority was for them to return, the research group writes in their report. "As much as I am glad that they returned to Kolis, in all probability we will not be able to make any further discoveries and even after this time would probably never find such new evidence for what we now consider to be the most important known sites in Europe and beyond," they write.
